Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This web page is about some of the content reviewed in the Lectures 0 and 1. index.html is the main page of the website. Here you can find what the website is about using Bootstrap 4 cards for styling. In page2.html is some information about html tags using a grid. Within page3.html is some information about how to get start using GitHub. The scss variables, inheritance and nesting were used here. In page4.html is some information about some Bootstrap 4 components. Here I used a table and Bootstrap 4 components inside that table. The @media for mobile-responsiveness is used in the "footer", the links at the bottom of the page to move around the website, in order to avoid text overlap mainly in page3.html.
