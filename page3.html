	    	<h2>How to use GitHub?</h2>
	    	<p class="main_p">Once you have installed git (if it is not already installed follow <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this instructions</a>) and created a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>. Here are some steps to getting sarted with this tool.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div id="body-text">
    		<div class="step">
	    		<h3>Create a local git repository:</h3>
	    		<p>
	    			When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you must first create a new repository. To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your computer. Once you placed inside the directory, run the git init command to initialize a git repository in the root of the folder.
	    		</p>
    		</div>
    		<div class="step">
	    		<h3>Add a new file to the repo:</h3>
	    		<p>
	    			Add a new file to the project using any text editor you like. Once you have added or modified files in a folder containing a git repository, git will notice that changes have been made inside it. But, git won't officially keep track of the file unless you explicitly tell it to. After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add <span><span><</span>filename<span>></span></span> command.
	    		</p>

	    		<p>
	    			A commit is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make changes to your repo and then tell git to put those files into a commit. This way you can go back to the state of a project at any point.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Once you have used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the git commit command.
	    		</p>
    		</div>
    		<div class="step">
	    		<h3>Create a commit:</h3>
	    		<p>
	    			Run the command git commit -m "Your message about the commit". The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains. Don't put a message like "asdfadsf" or "foobar". That makes the other people who see your commit confused.
	    		</p>
	    	</div>
	    	<div class="step">
	    		<h3>Create a new branch:</h3>
	    		<p>
	    			Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. Once you're done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the master branch. When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch 'branched' off of, so it knows the history behind all the files. 
	    		</p>

	    		<p>
	    			Run git checkout -b <span><span><</span>my branch name<span>></span></span>. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the master branch. 
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			After running the above command, you can use the git branch command to confirm that your branch was created.
